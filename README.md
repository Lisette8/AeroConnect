<h1>✈️ AeroConnect</h1>

AeroConnect is a web-based airport management application developed as part of a university project.
It provides a modern, secure, and user-friendly solution for managing flights and reservations.

<h2>🎯 Main Objectives</h2>
The main goal of AeroConnect is to simplify the consultation and management of airline flights through a modern web application based on a Springboot and Angular architecture.

<h2>📦 Technologies</h2>

- `Angular`
- `Springboot`
- `MySQL`
- `REST API`
- `TypeScript`

<h2>📚 What I Learned</h2>
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application.
We worked on creating and managing data using CRUD operations, implementing user roles and authentication,
designing REST APIs, and connecting an Angular frontend with a Springboot backend using a relational database.
